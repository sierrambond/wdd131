            <h2>Plant Care by Type</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the plant care section! Here you will find tips and tricks to keep your plants healthy and thriving.
            </p>

                <h3>Different Types of Plants</h3>
                <p>
                    Knowing what type of care each plant needs is key to helping them thrive. Every plant species has its own unique 
                    preferences, and understanding these can ensure your plants not only survive but flourish.

                <h2>Watering Needs</h2>
                <p>
                    Watering is one of the most critical aspects of plant care. Different plants have vastly different requirements 
                    for water. Understanding each plant's needs can help avoid overwatering or underwatering.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Succulents</h3>
                <p>
                    Succulents are hardy plants that require infrequent watering. Overwatering is a common mistake that can lead to 
                    root rot. Water them thoroughly, but only when the soil is completely dry.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Ferns</h3>
                <p>F
                    erns thrive in moist conditions. They prefer regular watering to maintain humidity around their roots. Ensure 
                    the soil remains consistently moist, but not soggy, and consider misting them to replicate a more humid environment.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Pothos</h3>
                <p>
                    Pothos are adaptable plants that do well with moderate watering. Let the soil dry out slightly between waterings. 
                    They are forgiving and can tolerate some missed waterings.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Light Requirements</h2>
                <p>
                    Different plants have varying light preferences. Some plants thrive in bright, direct light, while others do well 
                    in lower light conditions.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Low Light Plants</h3>
                <p>
                    Plants like pothos and snake plants do well in low light. These plants are great for spaces with indirect sunlight 
                    or areas further from windows.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Bright Light Plants</h3>
                <p>
                    Succulents, cacti, and other sun-loving plants need plenty of direct sunlight. Place these plants near windows where 
                    they can soak up the rays.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Soil Preferences</h2>
                <p>
                    Soil is another important factor in plant health. Different plants require different types of soil to grow well.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Succulents</h3>
                <p>Succulents require well-draining soil that prevents water from sitting around their roots, which can lead to rot.

                </p>
                
                <h3>Ferns</h3>
                <p>Ferns enjoy slightly more moisture-retentive, loamy soil that holds some moisture around their roots but still 
                    drains well.
                </p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Humidity and Temperature</h2>
                    <p>
                        Humidity plays a significant role in plant health, especially for tropical plants.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Succulents and Cacti</h3>
                    <p>Succulents and cacti thrive in dry, warm environments. They do not need high humidity, so make sure the air 
                        around them remains dry.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Ferns and Tropical Plants</h3>
                    <p>Ferns and tropical plants, like calatheas, enjoy higher humidity levels. To keep them happy, consider using a 
                        humidity tray or a room humidifier, especially during dry seasons.
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Fertilizing</h2>
                    <p>Most plants benefit from periodic feeding to support healthy growth. Be sure to tailor your fertilizer 
                        approach based on the plant type.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Succulents</h3>
                    <p>Succulents can go without fertilizer for months, as they grow slowly. During the growing season, you can apply 
                        a diluted fertilizer once a month.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Ferns and Pothos</h3>
                    <p>Ferns and pothos benefit from regular feeding with a diluted liquid fertilizer during the growing season, which 
                        is typically spring and summer.

                    <h2>General Care Tips</h2>
                    <p>Creating a care calendar for your plants can help you stay organized and ensure that your plants get the attention 
                        they need. Tracking watering schedules, light exposure, and fertilization is a great way to keep your plants 
                        healthy and thriving.
