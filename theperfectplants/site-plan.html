      </p>
      <p><b>Skill Levels</b></p>
      <p>
        We know that taking on a new plant comes with its own set of challenges and the team here at The Perfect Plants wants to lighten that burden for you. We will have a step by step guide of what to do as soon as you buy a new plant that starts with other companion items you can get at the store you are getting your plant at. It will take you through treating pests and how to repot. It will also tell you where to put the plant in your house for optimal humidity and lighting. If you’ve got pets and you are looking to buy a new plant friend, our team will tell you which plants to steer clear of and which ones are pet friendly. In our opinion, one of the best ways to show love and friendship is by sharing plants. One way to share the gift of plants is by propagating the plants that you already have, know, and love. It saves you money, but it definitely will take some time, trial, and error to get that skill down.

      <h3>Plant Care by Type</h3>
      <p><b>Different Types of Plants</b></p>
      <p>
        One very important part of keeping plants alive is to know what kind of care they need! Everyone, no matter their green thumb status, can grow houseplants! You just need to be matched to the right plant based on the care you want to give. Lots of people get succulents because they look cute or are trendy to get, and then they think they need to water it more than is necessary. This causes the plant to die. If you’re looking to water something more often, it would be a safer bet to get a plant that has well-draining soil.
      </p>
      <p><b>Soil</b></p>
      <p>
        Some plants like to keep it humid and keep their soil moist which requires a different type of soil than a lot of other plants. Most other plants I’ve seen need well-draining soil. The type of soil could be life or death to the plant so beware of its needs. Many of the plants on the Facebook groups I’m in are rooted in water bases. Some are just straight up put in water, and some are planted in a leca and water combination. Leca is a substitute for soil made with small clay pebbles which help retain moisture.

      <h3>Propagation Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <p><b>Strategies</b></p>
      <p>
        When it comes to the plant life cycle, propagation is one way to have a new beginning. Propagation is when you take an existing part of your plant and allow it to grow into a new baby plant. When this is done with succulents, you typically see leaves being taken off the bottom of the mother plant and then set aside in their grow area/tray to allow for roots to grow. Another way to do this is taking the leaves and/or stems of certain plants and sticking it in water to allow for root growth.
      </p>
      <p><b>African Violets</b></p>
      <p>
        Lots of plants, like the common pothos plants, have nodes which are where the roots come out. So, when propagating pothos plants, you should cut in between the nodes. My mother has had a pothos plant for about 3 years and because they are vining plants, the stem gets super long. To keep up with maintenance, she would give the plant a trim but also get a new plant out of that trim. Whenever I have tried to propagate succulents in the past, I have not been at all successful. However, my grandma has been very successful in propagating African Violets. I will be giving a step by step with pictures on how to propagate like my grandma does. She started with one plant she bought years and years ago but now her kitchen is filled with her propagation station consisting with a majority of African Violets.
